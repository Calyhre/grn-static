# About Green Ruby

## Genesis

The Newsletter began in june 2012 from the habit I had to
send weekly newsletter in [Codegreen][1] for our team to know what is
happenning in our company,. That was purely a teamwork tool for general
transparency. But with time passing I also included there some links to
what I was finding around that would be of interest for my geek colleagues.

That CodeGreen Internal newsletter began to be cluttered with various links
at the bottom of it. So I decided to separate that links gathering bunch in
another newsletter. But then it could also be useful for my friends, out of
the scope of our team.

## Green Birth

At that time I had to test [Mailchimp][2] service for one of our projects, so because
they offer a free package when volume is not too big, I thought I should just create
that newsletter as a public freeely available publication.

So in february 2013 I sent the first Green Ruby Newsletter to 3 subscribers. Well,
mostly our team :) Then it became a weekly habit, so I got a domain name for it,
and organicaly it's growing slowly.

## The redactor gear

A first Codegreen paid for my [Newsblur][3] account so I can follow a bunch of feeds.
Google reader was my first tool but well, they have closed, and actually Newsblur was much
better. It's open source and the guy that makes it does a great job (too bad it's in
python and not in ruby).

After some time I diversified my tools for gathering news. My mailbox is where I get
most of the links, but I also use Feedspot, Prismatic, and a bunch of bookmarks that
I check every week.

I'm also loading a bunch of podcasts on my phone and after having tried a lot of
podcast softwares I've been happy with [Podkicker][4], it's just very convenient and
it has all I need with the free version. So in my 40 minutes tele commuting to go
to work, I just get the ears busy. Now I switched to Listen Up Free vversion, because
it sync pretty well with [Gpodder][5].

But I also get a lot of news by just wandering around on [Geekli.st][10], on [Coderbits][11],
hacker news, and I subscribed to a bunch of various newsletters. I also watch the new gems
feeds from [@rubygems-alt][12] and I retweet stuff of interest on [@mo5e][17], [@cogtw][13] and/or
[@greenrubist][16] (those 3 are my alternate twitter identities).

Each week [William][14] (aka xenor) also sends me a list of links. I definately
don't use any facebook feeds. For some reason, this is a place I avoid the most I can.

## First year

One year passed. Not one week came without its pubication. It became a sunday routine for me,
with various benifits for myself and my friends. Few people subscribed each week from the website.

There have been various attempts to automate the publication tool, using ember, or other toys.
But the most reliable toolset ended up being a couple of rake tasks for producing the mailchimp
template and the website content. Some hope can be preserved about the evolution of the platform,
but I have been busy quite a bunch, changing job, as well as xenor, that helped me with some links
each weeks.

The non-commercial aspect of this media is stronger than ever. It's actually too small scale to
have any cost. Mailchimp still is free for so few subscribers.
