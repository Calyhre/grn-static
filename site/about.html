          <h1>About Green Ruby</h1>
          
          <h2>Genesis</h2>
          
          <p>The Newsletter began in june 2012 from the habit I had to
          send weekly newsletter in <a href="http://codegreenit.com" title="Code Green website">Codegreen</a> for our team to know what is
          happenning in our company,. That was purely a teamwork tool for general
          transparency. But with time passing I also included there some links to
          what I was finding around that would be of interest for my geek colleagues.</p>
          
          <p>That CodeGreen Internal newsletter began to be cluttered with various links
          at the bottom of it. So I decided to separate that links gathering bunch in
          another newsletter. But then it could also be useful for my friends, out of
          the scope of our team.</p>
          
          <h2>Green Birth</h2>
          
          <p>At that time I had to test <a href="http://mailchimp.com" title="Mass mailing from the Chimps">Mailchimp</a> service for one of our projects, so because
          they offer a free package when volume is not too big, I thought I should just create
          that newsletter as a public freeely available publication.</p>
          
          <p>So in february 2013 I sent the first Green Ruby Newsletter to 3 subscribers. Well,
          mostly our team :) Then it became a weekly habit, so I got a domain name for it,
          and organicaly it's growing slowly.</p>
          
          <h2>The redactor gear</h2>
          
          <p>A first Codegreen paid for my <a href="http://newsblur.com" title="RSS feeds aggregation and reader">Newsblur</a> account so I can follow a bunch of feeds.
          Google reader was my first tool but well, they have closed, and actually Newsblur was much
          better. It's open source and the guy that makes it does a great job (too bad it's in
          python and not in ruby).</p>
          
          <p>After some time I diversified my tools for gathering news. My mailbox is where I get
          most of the links, but I also use Feedspot, Prismatic, and a bunch of bookmarks that
          I check every week.</p>
          
          <p>I'm also loading a bunch of podcasts on my phone and after having tried a lot of
          podcast softwares I've been happy with <a href="http://www.podkicker.com/" title="Podkicker">Podkicker</a>, it's just very convenient and
          it has all I need with the free version. So in my 40 minutes tele commuting to go
          to work, I just get the ears busy. Now I switched to Listen Up Free vversion, because
          it sync pretty well with <a href="https://gpodder.net/user/mose" title="Mose podcasts list on gPodder">Gpodder</a>.</p>
          
          <p>But I also get a lot of news by just wandering around on <a href="https://geekli.st/" title="Geeks social network">Geekli.st</a>, on <a href="https://coderbits.com" title="Skill gathering for geeks">Coderbits</a>,
          hacker news, and I subscribed to a bunch of various newsletters. I also watch the new gems
          feeds from <a href="https://twitter.com/RubyGemsAlt" title="Tweet feed of uploaded gems">@rubygems-alt</a> and I retweet stuff of interest on <a href="https://twitter.com/mo5e" title="Personal tweet feed of mose">@mo5e</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cogtw" title="Technical News tweet feed from mose at code green">@cogtw</a> and/or
          <a href="https://twitter.com/grenrubist" title="New tweet feed from Green Ruby">@greenrubist</a> (those 3 are my alternate twitter identities).</p>
          
          <p>Each week <a href="https://github.com/tubaxenor" title="The Xenor with his tuba">William</a> (aka xenor) also sends me a list of links. I definately
          don't use any facebook feeds. For some reason, this is a place I avoid the most I can.</p>
          
          <h2>First year</h2>
          
          <p>One year passed. Not one week came without its pubication. It became a sunday routine for me,
          with various benifits for myself and my friends. Few people subscribed each week from the website.</p>
          
          <p>There have been various attempts to automate the publication tool, using ember, or other toys.
          But the most reliable toolset ended up being a couple of rake tasks for producing the mailchimp
          template and the website content. Some hope can be preserved about the evolution of the platform,
          but I have been busy quite a bunch, changing job, as well as xenor, that helped me with some links
          each weeks.</p>
          
          <p>The non-commercial aspect of this media is stronger than ever. It's actually too small scale to
          have any cost. Mailchimp still is free for so few subscribers.</p>
