  "There was some much publications this week, it is harder and harder to make a selection. Also, I begin to have too long a list of podcasts and sometimes I can't listen to them all. Should I focus more? It would be annoying as I like eclecticism, in a certain range. Anyways, I'm happy to announce we almost have 500 subscribers by now, and more and more traffic on the website. You may laugh, but as I don't like google and their analytics/tracking, I use the good old webalizer for the <a href=\"http://greenruby.org/stats/\">Greenruby site stats</a>. So vintage! Maybe one day I will setup a piwik though."
