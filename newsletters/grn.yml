  "As there is a lot of new subscribers this week, let me remind you what this newsletter is.<br>I'm a french fullstack <a href=\"http://mose.com\">geek</a> living in Taiwan, ruby lover, and currently in a devops phase. I don't have much time to surf around during the week as I have a fulltime job. So every Sunday I dedicate 4 to 6 hours to sort my inbox, check stuff, track what's new, so I can remain current. <br>And then as I'm doing it for myself, well, I structured it a bit and sent my review to some friends. <a href=\"http://mailchimp.com\">Mailchimp</a> offers a free tier, the review is done already, why not share it to a wider audience. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tubaxenor\">Xenor</a> sends me some links every week, as well as various other people now. Having more people reading it and appreciating this review helps me to stay motivated doing it every week. So, thanks for that."
