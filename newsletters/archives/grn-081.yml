  "Hmm I really don't like my icons. I added categories from time to time and got some random icon to match them. Now I look at the result and I don't like it. Maybe someone can suggest a collection that could match the Green Ruby categories collection? For example the ops and tool categories are too identical. and I need a generic engineering category too. It would be so lovely to have a uniform look for our icons. Maybe some monochrome Heroku style kind of 16 pixel icons. So, if you feel you can help, contact me at <a href=\"mailto:mose@greenruby.org\">mose@greenruby.org</a>."
