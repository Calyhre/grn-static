  "This week I opened a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Green-Ruby/1413063455616628\">facebook</a> page and a <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103851980502956488088\">google+</a> too, in more than the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/greenrubist\">twitter</a> account. Not that I'm really into it but I wanted to try bufferapp, which is pretty neat. So you can check links there during the week. Also note that there may be more links in those feeds than in the newsletter, and the newsletter has links that are not in the feed."
