  "For those that live in Taiwan (or plan to pay us a visit on this amazingly geeky island) note in your calendar the <a href=\"http://railspacific.com/\">Rails Pacific</a> conference in september. Also, I hope you hugged your favorite sysadmin on friday. Puppetlab organized a <a href=\"http://puppetlabs.com/gif-contest/sysadmin-appreciation-day-2014\">gif contest</a> on the topic, but I really prefer the gifs from <a href=\"http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com/\">DevOps reactions</a>. (and yeah, the sysadminday website went down on sysadmin day, pretty ironically)."
