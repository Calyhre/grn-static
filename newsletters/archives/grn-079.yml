  "As maybe you know that's a long time I wish to make the green ruby website dynamic, especially to feature a search engine on all the links. But I never found time yet. So if you feel like contributing, please to <a href=\"mailto:news@greenruby.org\">contact me</a>. Ideally I would think about some pre-generated json db and a js only frontend, so then there is no need for a backend. The source code of the current static site and generation scripts is <a href=\"https://github.com/greenruby/grn-static\">on github</a>"
