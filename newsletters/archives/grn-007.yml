  "Ah yet another rails upgrade! And this one looks problematic so we may get yet another one next week. While upgrading each time, just try focusing on how secure rails is becoming with all that fuss. Btw, if you get any news in non english that make a reference in your local area, feel free to share I will be happy to include it. It's a matter of ambiance, I just like it multi-cultural :)"

    comment: "yes, that's another security release, the 3.2.13 (and other point versions), fixing XSS and DOS vulnerabilities. But careful, this release seems to have regression problems (for example the <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/1440-today-s-email-incident\">github case</a>). Handle with care."
