  "The ruby 2.0 release last week triggered a lot of other releases, with rubygems 2.0, passenger, rails, rspec, devise, rack, hobo, and many others. There is also some a rush on pull requests on ruby projects as people jump on ruby 2 and fix compatibilities issues on the way. A very interesting week."
