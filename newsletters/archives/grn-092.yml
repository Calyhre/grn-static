  "My new job is much deeper in devops than before. Gandi really is a great environment for real geeks. Rails and ruby still remains dear to my heart, but now this becomes a side interest for me. I hope I still can keep up with this weekly gathering of links. Some focus may change though. I'm switching now from chef to puppet, and I may have even more interest on devops links. But I will try to keep it balanced. Maybe organize the links gathering a little more collaboratively?"
