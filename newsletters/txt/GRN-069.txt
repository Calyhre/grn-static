Edito

Last week I officially launched at Faria, my current employer, a public tips website called <a href="http://devtips.faria.co">Faria Dev Tips</a>. I has a lot in common with Green Ruby. The topics covered are the same, it covers rails, ruby, js, devops, design, css, with the same fullstack approach. The origin of it is also very similar. Both come from internal communication and evolve to open sharing. Check it out, you may like it :)
