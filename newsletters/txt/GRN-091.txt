Edito

This week I left my job at <a href="http://faria.co">Faria</a> and I joined <a href="http://gandi.net">Gandi Asia</a>, as a devops again. The consequence is that I'm flying to Paris next week for one month. I wonder if I will be able to feed up Greenruby links curation as regularly as usual. That may be challenging. In the while, check out the <a href="http://railsrumble.com/entries/winners">Rails Rumble Winners</a> for this year, there is some cool things.
