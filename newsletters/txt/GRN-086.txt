Edito

This is the week of <a href="http://bashsmash.ccsir.org/">ShellShock</a>, as most of you already know, this is going to be a troubled time for old servers again (well, who still uses cgi scripts, right?). On a brighter side, I also went to <a href="http://eventifier.com/event/railspacific14/popular">rails pacific</a> yesterday, it was nice to meet some Green Ruby subscribers there.
