Green Ruby News #079 - aug 10th 2014
----------------------------------------------------

Edito
----------------------------------------------------
As maybe you know that's a long time I wish to make the green ruby website dynamic, especially to feature a search engine on all the links. But I never found time yet. So if you feel like contributing, please to contact me [1]. Ideally I would think about some pre-generated json db and a js only frontend, so then there is no need for a backend. The source code of the current static site and generation scripts is on github [2].
