Green Ruby News #026 - aug 4th 2013
-------------------------------

Edito
-----------------
This week I changed job and also my hat. I became a fulltime system administrator. It may have some consequences on the green ruby publication, because I am switching gears. Hopefully we will have a more contributive platform very soon. But in the while, feel free to send me links to help compensate. On another hand, I'm thinking about making a new publication about devops. It's just because I use publication as a way to self-hack myself into more structured organization of my awareness of what happens around. Like a public bookmarking, in some ways. More news about it next week...
