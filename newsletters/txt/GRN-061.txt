Edito
----------------------------------------------------
This month on 25th there is a rubyconf in Taipei, so I prepared simple stickers because geeks like to stick stuff on their laptops. If you want some, just come there, or send me a mail see if I can send you a bunch of them.
Side Note: There is no stupid april's fool joke in this edition (pfew).
