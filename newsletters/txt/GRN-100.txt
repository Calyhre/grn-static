Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

This week is the 100th edition of Green Ruby, it's also the first one of 2015. Tis week the [Linux Outlaws][1] broadcasted their last show, and Rebecca Watson left the [Skeptics Guide to the Universe][2]. Those are 2 podcasts that I never list in the Green Ruby list (they are not really on topic) but I rarely miss any of them. Too bad they leave. I thought about it too, but no, I will stay.

So, happy new year or, as we say in french: Bananier!

For 100 weeks already I gathered those links and sent them to whoever wants them. Every damn single week. Just for the fun of it. This is a kind of personal kata, it keeps me in the loop. I just make my exercise in a way I can share it. And my streak of never missing one week is a kind of personal challenge.

There is now 971 subscribers to the mail newsletter, a hole lot of people prefer to subscribe using the RSS feed, and the website has 8 or 9k visits per month. But this is still a side project, with no business behind it, just one single guy and a couple of friends sharing the result of their weekly review of the news of their craft.

So, as you can notice, this edito becomes a rant, and is going to get a bit longer. For a while I was trying to keep it short just because it sits on the top of the letter and what matters are the links and not the ranting. By moving the blah blah at the bottom I free myself from format constraints and can unleash my writing desires. muahaha. Not that I have much to say. But you can consider this new section of Green Ruby as the last screen displayed in [The Big Band Theory][3], where producers display some random thoughts, rants or anecdote, that you need to pause for being able to read.

Another significant change is that I disabled the link tracking in Mailchimp. As a matter of fact I dislike the trackling-by-default attitude. I have been able to see how much clicks we had on each edition, but this is not really something I totally need. It's more about curiosity. It revealed that links to books were quite popular, so I paid attention to add some of those. And I could notice that links on the top of the letter are more clicked, but I don't need metrics for knowing that.

The result will be much better text-only newsletter with shorter links, and faster clicks as it doesn't pass through mailchimp anymore. And also, it's one more step toward the rebellion against generalized tracking. Yeahaa!
