Edito

Now there are 100 subscribers to this newsletter, from 28 different countries. Nothing compared to the other publishers out there, but I have no time and interest in promotion. After all this weekly mail was just intended to be sent to a dozen of friends. And it went on like a personal habit, forcing me to keep in touch with the flow. Anyways, if I don't know you and if you like it, I'm happy enough. (and xenor is too). Happy hollidays if you get any!
