On friday I will get to <a href="http://rubyconf.tw/2014/">RubyConf Taiwan</a> and will spread some Green Ruby stickers. I sent some last week and can send some more. If you would like to have some just <a href="mailto:mose@greenruby.org">contact me</a>. Another notable event this week was the release of ubuntu 14.04, I installed the gnome version on my desktop and it's running pretty well.
