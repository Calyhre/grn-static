Green Ruby News #074 - jul 6th 2014
----------------------------------------------------

Edito
----------------------------------------------------
This week we had a rails upgrade for security (but only concerns postgres) and another one immediately for fixing a regression in the security fix. It happens sometimes. But there is so much more happening all around. It's very hard to compose this letter because I have to pick news from such a massive amount of new things. But here it is, enjoy :)
