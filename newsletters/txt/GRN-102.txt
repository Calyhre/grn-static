Rant
----------------------------------------------------
The random rant of the week by mose.

#### While42

This week I got in contact with Sylvain from [while42][1]. It's a social
network for french tech engineers, but with a special touch on it. There is no
facebook page or google group. They intentionally decided to be irl-first. For
people that are most likely to be online all the time, this sounds so
therapeutic! So, I decided, with Thomas from Gandi, to setup a Taiwan chapter.
If you want to know more (and are french, engineer, and living in Taipei) just
drop me a mail.

#### Traveling ruby

This is a project from the [Phusion][2] people, called [Traveling ruby][3].
Its purpose is to make it easy to build auto-sustaining tarballs for ruby
programms, including ruby binary and all gems in it. That way you can publish
a tarball and your customer/user will just launch whatever you put in it. No
need to install ruby or any gems.

I gave it a try yesterday on my [zabbix-ruby-client][4] gem, and after a few
tweaks (mostly because I wanted to use an unpublished version of my gem), it
all worked pretty fine. Result is a tarball of 8M. Uploaded to the server (an
old squeeze), it just ran the self-contained ruby 2.1.5 with no hassle. It
reminded me a bit of the feeling when you upload a go executable on the
server. Really neat.

#### Palm control

There are tiny things that can change a lot. My recent tiny thing is the palm
control technique. Every sunday when I prepare Green Ruby I do a huge amount
of copy pasting all over the place. Recently I found on a post about keyboard
someone talking about the palm control technique for avoiding the copypaste
fatigue.

Well, you need to have a keyboard that makes it possible. Mine is a [Logitech
washable k310][5]. I already liked its look, and even better, it's perfect for
this palm thing because keys are prominent. Use the palm to push control and
then it's only a matter of hitting c or v with the index. Honestly, it changed
my life!
